# Protocols

At Ockamâ€™s core are a collection of cryptographic and messaging protocols. These protocols make it possible to create **private** and **secure by design** applications that provide end-to-end application layer trust it data.

#### [Application Layer Routing](routing.md)

Ockam Routing and Transports enable protocols that provide end-to-end guarantees to messages traveling across many network connection hops and protocols boundaries.

#### [Secure Channels](secure-channels.md)

Ockam Secure Channels are mutually authenticated and end-to-end encrypted messaging channels that guarantee data authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality.
